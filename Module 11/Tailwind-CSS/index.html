    <h2>Learning Tailwind CSS</h2>
    <p>Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It provides low-level
        utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without ever leaving your HTML.</p>
    <p class="text-3xl">With Tailwind CSS, you can apply styles directly to your HTML elements using predefined classes
        , making it easy to create responsive and consistent designs. It also supports customization through
        configuration files, allowing you to tailor the framework to your project's needs.</p>
    <p class="text-center">To get started with Tailwind CSS, you can include it in your project via a
        CDN link or install it using npm or yarn. Once set up, you can start using the utility classes to style your
        HTML elements.</p>
